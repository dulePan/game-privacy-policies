Privacy policy for game Idle Box Factory

Idle Box Factory: Privacy policy Welcome to the Idle Box Factory game for Android!

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Explanation of permissions requested in the app The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

idleboxfactory/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
 <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"/>

Permission Why it is required:
android.permission.INTERNET Required to connect to internet in order to show ads in game.
com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID Required to show ads in game, so I could monitize this work :)
android.permission.VIBRATE Required for vibrating device
android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Required for reading external storage.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a comment in game, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Agnis. Belgrade, Serbia. agnis.design@gmail.com
